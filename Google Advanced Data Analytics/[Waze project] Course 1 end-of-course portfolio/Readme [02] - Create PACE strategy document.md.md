**Subject:** Welcome to Waze!

**From:** “May Santner,” <ins>May@waze</ins>

Hello, and welcome to the team! 

We are so happy to have you. We have been growing quickly and we can really use your expertise. 

Leadership has asked our team to build a machine learning model that predicts user churn. The model will be based on a sample of Waze user data. An accurate model will help our company prevent user churn, improve user retention, and increase growth. 

For your first task, please draft a plan of action for the team. Include questions we need to answer before we get started on the project, important details to consider at the beginning of the project, and action items for different stages of the project. 

I understand you’ve completed a Google Careers Certificate on Advanced Data Analytics and learned the skills for planning, analyzing, constructing, and executing strategies for data science. Sylvester did one of the Google certificates and really loved it. They learned some incredible skills. Maybe you can use the skills you learned in that program to get started? 

I really appreciate your help. Again, welcome to the team! 

May Santner
