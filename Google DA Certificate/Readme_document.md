### List of contents

### Background

In this project, I am a junior data analyst who is working as part of the marketing team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. Since the company launched a successful bike-share offering in 2016, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Now, Cyclistic has three flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Moreno, the director of marketing team, has set a goal that aimed to convert casual riders into annual members. Therefore, my task is to analysis Cyclistic historical bike trip data to provide information that will lead to data-driven decision.
