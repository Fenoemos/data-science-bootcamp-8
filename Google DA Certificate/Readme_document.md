### Before start
I have recently completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program on Coursera. As part of this course, students are required to complete a data analysis case study to show the skills learned throughout the course and here is my capstone project. For this case study, I used excel and R programming for the data preparation and visualization analysis.
