### Before start

I have recently completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program on Coursera. As part of this course, students are required to complete a data analysis case study to show the skills learned throughout the course and here is my capstone project. For this case study, I used excel and R programming for the data preparation and visualization analysis. Moreover, this project will be followed these steps to ensure its completion:
  * Follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
  * Follow the given guild in roadmap with:
      + Code, if needed on the step.
      + Guiding questions, with answers.
      + Key tasks, as a checklist.
      + Deliverable, as a checklist.

### Background

In this project, I am a junior data analyst who is working as part of the marketing team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. Since the company launched a successful bike-share offering in 2016, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Now, Cyclistic has three flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Moreno, the director of marketing team, has set a goal that aimed to convert casual riders into annual members; however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and team members are interested in analyzing Cyclistic bike trip to identify trends. So, these insights will lead my team to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations.

Therefore, my task is to analyze Cyclistic historical bike trip data to provide information that will lead to data-driven decision.

### Ask
**Who're stakeholders:** 
 + Primary stakeholder: Cyclistic executive team as they will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program)
 + Secondary stakeholder: Lily Moreno, the director of marketing and my manager, as she is responsible for the campaigns development to promote benefit to convert Cyclistic's casual riders to become annual members.

**My task**
As Moreno has assigned the first question to me: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

So, my business task is to determine the differences between annual members and casual riders and which marketing strategy will help to increase annual members.
